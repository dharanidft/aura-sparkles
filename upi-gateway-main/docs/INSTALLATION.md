# Web Installation Wizard

Every supported deployment method ends in this browser flow. cPanel and Ubuntu VPS instructions prepare PHP, MySQL, filesystem permissions, and the web server; the wizard then performs application setup.

## Before opening `/install`

Verify PHP 8.2+ and PDO, PDO MySQL, OpenSSL, mbstring, tokenizer, JSON, cURL, fileinfo, and XML. Create an empty MySQL 8.x or MariaDB 10.x/11.x database and a user able to create and alter tables. The prepared package must contain `vendor/autoload.php` and `public/build/`.

The web root must be Laravel's `public/` directory. `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/` must be writable by PHP, and the application must be able to create `.env`. Use HTTPS in production. SQLite is not supported at runtime.

## Step-by-step wizard

1. Open `https://yourdomain.com/install`.
2. On **Server Requirements**, confirm green checks for PHP, PDO, PDO MySQL, OpenSSL, mbstring, tokenizer, JSON, cURL, writable `storage/`, and writable `.env` handling. Fix missing extensions or permissions and refresh.
3. On **Database Setup**, enter App Name and HTTPS App URL. MySQL is the only database type. Enter host, port (`3306` unless your host says otherwise), full database name, full username, and password, then select **Test connection and continue**.
4. After connection success, the wizard writes `.env` atomically, generates `APP_KEY` when needed, applies production-safe settings, and continues.
5. On **Run Migrations**, start migration to create the required tables. Failures show a generic message; fix database permissions/settings and retry.
6. On **Create Admin Account**, enter Full Name, Email Address, Password, and Confirm Password. The password must be at least 10 characters.
7. On **Installation Complete**, choose **Go to Login**. The installation marker locks the wizard. The API is unavailable before installation and the wizard cannot be reopened after success.

Configure merchant accounts, payment accounts, webhooks, queue processing, scheduled expiry processing, HTTPS, restricted permissions, and MySQL backups. See [CPANEL.md](CPANEL.md) or [VPS.md](VPS.md).
